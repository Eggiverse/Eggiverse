I'm currently working at SIPFLS.

I am teaching A-Level and IBDP physics. I am also managing internal exams, timetables etc.

I like to process all school data using latest tools.

My wish is that on some day, school data can run smoothly benefiting from the age of information.
Students can benefit too.

I am currently in a cat's state of machine learning and physics.

I like physics, programming and linguistics.
